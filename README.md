# Venture into the coding world
## Who am I?
Hi everyone, this is one of the first and hopefully one of many repositories I have created here on **GitHub**.
My name is Pawe≈Ç, and although I come from Finance/Tax/Accounting background, I have always had a passion to automation and coding.

## What is my goal?
I firmly believe that as more and more industries encounter digital revolution, not only developers will be needed, but also experts in the fields, who can understand and write code. I intend to:
1. Learn Python and VBA on the very well level (writing complete solutions ready to deploy).
2. Learn C# on a decent level (understand code and write small modifications).
3. Educate myself in terms of coding documentation, testing and secure deployment of GUI-based and web-based solutions.
